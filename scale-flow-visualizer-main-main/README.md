# Kubernetes Flow Visualizer

A modern web application for automating application scaling and load balancing using Kubernetes and NGINX Ingress.

## Features

- Real-time cluster metrics visualization
- Node and pod status monitoring
- Auto-scaling configuration controls
- Load balancer status and configuration
- Traffic visualization for NGINX Ingress
- Responsive design for all device sizes

## Technologies Used

- React with TypeScript
- Vite for fast development and building
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Recharts for data visualization
- Shadcn UI components
- React Router for navigation
- React Query for data fetching and state management

## Project Information

**URL**: https://lovable.dev/projects/0fb907ed-ab51-4b1d-a7f0-5f16ed0c910b

## Getting Started

To run this project locally:

```sh
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>

# Navigate to the project directory
cd kubernetes-flow-visualizer

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the development server
npm run dev
```

## Notes

This is a frontend demo using simulated data. In a real-world scenario, you would integrate this with actual Kubernetes API endpoints to manage and visualize your cluster.

The application currently demonstrates:
- Simulated real-time metrics updates
- Visualization of cluster health and status
- Interactive controls for scaling applications
- Traffic monitoring and analysis

## Future Enhancements

- Authentication and user management
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Historical metrics and trend analysis
- Infrastructure cost analysis
- Deployment automation features
- Advanced alerting capabilities
